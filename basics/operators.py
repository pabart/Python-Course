# Operators
# Operartors are special symbols that allow us to perform operations on variables and values.

# Arithmetic
# Are used to perform basic mathematical operations

a = 10
b = 3

sum = a + b # 13
substraction = a - b # 7
multiplication = a * b # 30
division = a / b # 3.3333333
floor_division = a//b # 3
modulus = a % b # 1
exponentation = a ** b # 1000

#Comparison
# Are used to compare two values and return a boolean value

a = 10
b = 3
equal = a == b # False
not_equal = a != b # True
greater_than = a > b # True
less_than = a < b # False
greater_or_equal = a >= b # True
less_or_equal = a <= b # False

# Logical
# Are used to combina conditional expressions and evaluate multiple conditions

a = 10
b = 3

result_and = (a > 5) and (b < 5) # True
result_or = (a > 15) or (b < 5) # True
result_not = not (a > 5) # False
